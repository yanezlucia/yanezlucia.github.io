### CPSC-120
* Lab 8 

Lab 8, part 3, was one of my favorites labs because it was so cool to see how easily we could make a program that would run these animations. It was also a really great learning expierence where i learned how to sleep the computer in order to make the animations work. As well as learning about the different ways we can make a program fun!

* Lab 10 

Lab 10, part 3, was another one of my favprite labs because we got to create our very first image. I really liked this one because I got to learn how to make a program that creates an image. This helped me learn about the differnet ways we can make programs as well as learning about GraphicsMagick library. 

* Lab 12

In Lab 12, part 2 I learned a lot of new things like how to us unit testing as well as learning how to use the random number generator. 
I really liked this lab because I learned how to create my own animated GIF. This was so much fun to make and surprisingly very easy. I loved learning about the endless possibilities it comes to when creating programs. Knowing that we can make these kinds of programs is astonshing.
